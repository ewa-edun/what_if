# ** "What If?" AI – The Alternate Reality Generator**  
**🌎 What If AI: A tool that generates alternate reality scenarios based on past decisions while explaining its reasoning transparently.**  

---

## **1️⃣ Core Features (MVP Scope)**  

### **🔮 User Input:**  
- Users enter a past decision they want to change.  
  - Example: *“What if I chose art instead of CS?”*  
- Users provide **optional context** (e.g., current job, skills, personality traits).  

### **🧠 AI Processing:**  
- AI **analyzes the decision** and **predicts an alternate outcome** using:  
  - **Data-driven logic** (historical trends, job market, statistics).  
  - **User personality analysis** (if provided).  
  - **Narrative-driven reasoning** (storytelling to make it engaging).  
- AI **explains its thought process** step by step:  
  - *“Because art jobs tend to be freelance-heavy, you might have struggled initially, but after X years, you could have…”*  

### **🛠 Customization Controls:**  
- **Optimistic Mode** – *Best possible version of events.*  
- **Realistic Mode** – *Most likely version based on data.*  
- **Chaotic Mode** – *Wild but still logical outcomes.*  

### **📖 Output (User Experience):**  
- The AI presents a **detailed yet readable** scenario.  
- Users can **see why** the AI predicted certain events.  
- Users can **adjust weightings** (e.g., prioritize personal skills vs. external factors).

## **2️⃣ Tech Stack & Challenges**  

### **💻 Backend (AI + Logic)**  
- **Language Model:** GPT-4-turbo or fine-tuned Llama for **story generation + reasoning explanation**.  
- **Data Analysis:** Use **real-world data (job stats, industry trends, life expectancy, etc.)** to ground predictions.  
- **Narrative Control:** Implement **few-shot prompting** or **retrieval-based generation** to avoid hallucinations.  

### **🖥 Frontend (User Interaction)**  
- **React** for a clean, interactive UI.  
- **Sliders/toggles** for choosing “Optimistic, Realistic, Chaotic.”  
- **Interactive explanation panel** where AI shows reasoning.  

### **🔗 API & Deployment**  
- **Nebius Cloud** (as required by the hackathon).  
- **Flask/FastAPI** to connect frontend & AI backend.  
- **Database (Firebase/SQL)** to save user scenarios for future iterations.

## **3️⃣ Expansion Ideas (Post-MVP)**  
🚀 **"Multiple Decisions" Mode** – Let users tweak multiple past choices and see **how they compound**.  
📊 **Data Dashboard** – Show **what factors had the most impact** in AI’s prediction.  
🤝 **"Compare with Friends" Mode** – Users can run scenarios **against their friends** to see **who made better life choices.**  
💡 **Gamified Outcomes** – Earn badges for the most *realistic*, *wild*, or *optimal* paths.
